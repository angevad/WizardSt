    ACTIVE TEMPLATE LIBRARY : atl_dll Project Overview
========================================================================

AppWizard has created this atl_dll project for you to use as the starting point for
writing your Dynamic Link Library (DLL).

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your project.

atl_dll.vcproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard.
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

atl_dll.idl
    This file contains the IDL definitions of the type library, the interfaces
    and co-classes defined in your project.
    This file will be processed by the MIDL compiler to generate:
        C++ interface definitions and GUID declarations (atl_dll.h)
        GUID definitions                                (atl_dll_i.c)
        A type library                                  (atl_dll.tlb)
        Marshaling code                                 (atl_dll_p.c and dlldata.c)

atl_dll.h
    This file contains the C++ interface definitions and GUID declarations of the
    items defined in atl_dll.idl. It will be regenerated by MIDL during compilation.

atl_dll.cpp
    This file contains the object map and the implementation of your DLL's exports.

atl_dll.rc
    This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the
    program uses.

atl_dll.def
    This module-definition file provides the linker with information about the exports
    required by your DLL. It contains exports for:
        DllGetClassObject
        DllCanUnloadNow
        DllRegisterServer
        DllUnregisterServer

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named atl_dll.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

Resource.h
    This is the standard header file that defines resource IDs.
